CUNY J(ournalism) Data
=========

It took me a few semesters to nail down my filing system, so there's a fair amount of detritus in this repository. But ... almost all of my teaching materials for my Data Driven Storytelling course at CUNY Graduate School of Journalism are nestled in here somewhere. 

If you found your way here because someone told you that I publish all my course material and it is super useful, you should probably start with my [Data Skills](https://github.com/amandabee/CUNY-data-skills/) class which is much more compact. Data Skills is a required first semester course in CUNY's Social Journalism Masters program. Data  Storytelling is a second or third semester elective in CUNY's MA in Journalism. 

This repository includes ...

ðŸ“‚ Assignments: 
+ week-by-week text describing homework assignments. I generally posted these to WordPress and went over them in class. 
+ topic overviews, which I would also post to Wordpress after class -- a repeat of whatever we walked through in class and enough instructions that a student could try it again unsupervised, possibly with a different data set.

ðŸ“‚ Lecture Notes:
+ notes for basic lessons, organized by the topic of the lesson

Unfortunately, I opted to keep the actual course plans for each week in a private document so that I could include a lot more specific notes about things I was seeing in homework. Since those notes include a lot of shorthand ("Amanda's assignment doesn't work b/c she didn't address normalization at all") where the students named deserve better and what I actually said in class was something much closer to "Here are six things that Amanda did really well, but let's figure out together why I have a problem with this." I needed to be able to be candid and quick so that all stays private for now.
